# Git Repo Analysis Tools

Git can become slow if a repository exceeds certain thresholds ([read this for details](http://larsxschneider.github.io/2016/09/21/large-git-repos)). Use the scripts explained below to identify possible culprits in a repository. The scripts have been tested on macOS but they should run on Linux as is.

_Hint:_ The scripts can run for a long time and output a lot lines. Pipe their output to a file (`./script.sh > myfile`) for further processing.

## Large by File Size
Use the [git-find-large-files.sh](git-find-large-files.sh) script to identity large files in your Git repository that you could move to [GitLFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (e.g. using [git-lfs-migrate](https://github.com/bozaro/git-lfs-migrate)).

Use the [git-find-lfs-extensions.py](git-find-lfs-extensions.py) script to identify certain file types that you could move to [GitLFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Large by File Count
Use the [git-find-dirs-many-files.sh](git-find-dirs-many-files.sh) and [git-find-dirs-unwanted.sh](git-find-dirs-unwanted.sh) scripts to identify directories with a large number of files. These might indicate 3rd party components that could be extracted.

Use the [git-find-dirs-deleted-files.sh](git-find-dirs-deleted-files.sh) to identify directories that have been deleted and used to contain a lot of files. If you purge all files under these directories from your history then you might be able significantly reduce the overall size of your repository.
